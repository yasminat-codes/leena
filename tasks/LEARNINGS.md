# Leena — Build Learnings (read before every wave, append after every fix)

**This file is a non-negotiable part of the build loop.** Every wave's agents MUST read this file *before* starting work, and MUST append new entries *after* any fix that worked. The goal: never repeat a mistake twice across waves.

## How to use this file

**BEFORE a wave starts** (every agent in the wave):
1. Read this entire file.
2. Read the `## Active Rules` section — these are hardened rules distilled from past fixes. Follow them.
3. Scan `## Wave Log` for entries tagged with files/subsystems you're about to touch.

**WHEN a fix works** (WAL checkpoint — stop, document, continue):
1. The moment a non-trivial fix makes a failing gate pass, STOP.
2. Append a `### Fix` entry to the current wave's section (template below).
3. If the fix reveals a general rule, also add/update a bullet in `## Active Rules`.
4. Resume work.

**AFTER a wave completes** (wave summary):
1. Append a `## Wave NN — summary` block: what was built, what broke, what was learned, time/retry stats.
2. Promote any recurring pattern (seen ≥2×) into `## Active Rules`.

## Active Rules (hardened — always apply)

> These start as the project's known constraints. Agents add to them as fixes accumulate.

- **kencode-search FIRST.** Before writing any new code, query the `kencode-search` MCP for production-ready implementations and to pull the FULL context of every file you'll modify. Never reinvent code that a vetted library/snippet already solves. If you have not pinpointed every section/place/symbol you need for context, search again before coding.
- **Never break current functionality.** The app already works as "Brah." Run the existing test suite (`node --test`) before and after every task. A passing-before / failing-after test = regression = the task is not done.
- **Simplest thing that works.** No over-engineering. If a simpler approach yields the same result, take it. Complexity is only acceptable when genuinely required. But it must *work* — never compromise correctness for brevity or vice-versa.
- **Match existing conventions.** Read neighboring files, `CLAUDE.md`, `biome.json`. Comment density, naming, and idiom must match surrounding code.
- **Provider primacy.** OpenAI subscription (OAuth) is the primary voice + chat path; the OpenAI API key is the backup. OpenRouter and Ollama are additional selectable providers. Ollama models are user-downloadable on demand.
- **`node:sqlite` only** for storage (no better-sqlite3). Use the existing `database.js` patterns and `withTempDir` + `closeDatabase` test helpers.
- **Native addons stay in `asarUnpack`** (`@nut-tree-fork/**`, onnxruntime native bits).
- **Tests are mandatory, not optional.** No task is complete without the tests named in its `## Tests Required`, and they must pass. E2E coverage for any user-facing flow.
- **Sub-agent completion reports are NOT evidence — verify on disk.** A dispatched agent returning "done" (even with high token/tool-use counts) may have written nothing, done adjacent work, or hallucinated a summary. After ANY dispatched agent: independently confirm the named output files exist, `git status --porcelain`/`git diff` is non-empty, and re-run `npm run check` + `node --test` yourself before trusting the result. *(Evidence: on 2026-06-01, three sub-agents reported success — `wave-writer`/`wave-writer2`/`ollama-model-download` — and two had written nothing; the wave files were claimed-written and were absent. Caught only by an on-disk `ls` count.)*
- **Verify content, not just structure.** File counts, section-header presence, and dependency-graph parity all pass even when section bodies are placeholder/hollow. Body-level verification (non-trivial content per section, numbered Steps, named test paths, atomicity cap) is mandatory for any generated artifact — a `wc -l` + `grep` pass is not enough.

## Wave Log

> Append below. Newest wave at the bottom. Never delete entries.

### Fix entry template
```
### Fix — Wave NN — <task id> — <one-line title>
- **Symptom:** what failed (exact error quoted)
- **Root cause:** why
- **Fix:** what changed (file:line)
- **Rule added?:** yes/no — if yes, which Active Rule
- **WAL ref:** tasks/.wal/<entry>
```

### Pre-build — 2026-06-01 — Decomposition-phase learnings (before any wave ran)
- **Sub-agent mis-reporting (3×):** `wave-writer`, `wave-writer2`, `ollama-model-download` returned "completed" but 2 of 3 wrote nothing (wave files absent). Fix: orchestrator now independently verifies every dispatched agent's output on disk (added to both run commands, Step 2.8 / Step 9). Rule promoted to Active Rules.
- **Structure-only verification missed thin sections:** initial decomposition QA used `wc -l` + `grep dependencies:` only; a later content-integrity sweep (12-section presence + ≥80-char bodies + numbered Steps ≤7 + named test paths + est_tokens ≤30k) found 15 terse-but-valid sections and 0 hollow files. Two test-suite tasks (040, 087) had test paths only in Steps, not in `## Tests Required` — enriched. Rule promoted to Active Rules.
- **Deliverable nearly shipped mock data:** MVP `.dmg` (046) originally depended only on backends, not wire-live tasks → would build an app showing Phase-0 mock screens. Fixed: added wake/MCP-free wire-live tasks 100/101/104 to 046's deps.
- **`.dmg` launch-check assumed a GUI:** 046/111 acceptance required `open`-launching the app, impossible headless. Split into headless structural checks (hdiutil verify, bundle present) for the autonomous path + an owner GUI checklist in DELIVERABLE.md.
